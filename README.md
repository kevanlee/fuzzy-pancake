===

Hi! Thanks for checking out the Fuzzy Pancake WordPress theme. This theme is designed for bloggers and personal brands -- but I guess you could use it for most anything!

Here are a few special features:

* Custom hero section where you can tell the world about you the cool things you do
* Featured posts in a card layout. You can show off whatever category you want
* Custom slideshow gallery for, well, slideshows
* Custom sidebars -- one for the main page and one for the footer of your posts
* Fully responsive. It looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Unique fonts: The theme uses Crimson Text and Lora.

Oh, and one more thing to know:

* Built by me, a writer and not a developer, meaning "things might break occasionally but I'm trying my best thanks for understanding"

Getting Started
---------------
If you want to use this theme for your WordPress website, you can [download the zip file from Dropbox here]().

A couple notes when you install it to WordPress from a Mac:

* You'll want to unzip it, then change the name of the folder to 'pancake'
* Once unzipped, you may need to delete any extra hidden files that Mac OS adds to folders. You can follow [Ian's instructions here](http://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/)) for showing hidden files.  
* Then one last thing: you'll want to remove DS_Store before you re-zip and upload. Here's how:

> If you do not mind jumping down in to terminal, then this is pretty darn easy. If you are in /Users/username, which is your $HOME directory and there is a subdirectory named foo that you want to zip but ignore all .DS_Store files, then do the following:

> zip -r foo.zip foo -x "*.DS_Store"

Fuzzy Pancake settings

All pancake settings are conveniently located in the Customize area of WordPress.

1. Update the hero headings and subheads and button links on the homepage.

Also, there a few things you can edit using the built-in WordPress Widgets section. You can add any widget to the author box that shows up at the end of single posts.
